                    hour-and-a-half drive from PDX airport</a>. We've reserved the entire resort for the weekend, and we'd love to have all our out-of-town guests spend both Friday and Saturday night with us there. You'll be able to make individual reservations once we've gathered RSVPs; we'll send an email to give you the go-ahead.

                    In October, Mount Hood tends to have high temperatures around 60 degrees and lows in the upper 30s, and the likelihood of rain on any given day is about 30%. Most of the pathways at the resort are paved, but you can expect to do some walking on gravel and uneven ground. We recommend dressing in warm layers and comfortable shoes.
